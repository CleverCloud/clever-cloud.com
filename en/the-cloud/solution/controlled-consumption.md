               Scaling your app up and down automatically is a great feature, but you should not lose sight of cost control in the case of very high traffic. In order to allow for a simple monitoring process, Clever Cloud chose a straightforward image: the gas tank of a car.
            </p>
			   <p>
               You get to fill your virtual tank with computer power –represented by drops- and then all you have to do is to monitor your activity. Once you run out of drops, you can fill the tank again without any intervention on our part.
            </p>
            <h2>The Drop&nbsp;: unit of computing energy</h2>
            <p>
			   The Drop is the unit representing Clever Cloud's "computing energy". You fuel your app with Drops, in case of need.
            </p>
			   <p>
				   The Clever Cloud dashboard shows you in real time what’s left in the tank in terms of drops, time and consumed computing energy&nbsp;:

				   <li>The estimated time before the next recharge</li>
