               To enjoy automatic scalability without losing control of your costs because of very high trafic on your app, Clever Cloud has been inspired by a simple and well known model&nbsp;: the gas tank of you car.
            </p>
			<p>
               Like it, you fill a virtual tank of "computing power" in your Clever Cloud's account. The tank empties in time, over consumption of your app's hosting.
